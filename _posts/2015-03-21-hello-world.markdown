Hello!

This is my first post, just a post to greet all the people who want to read me. 

**I'm not an expert in any area**, but I will try to explain all the things that I consider useful or interesting, so I hope you find something that could help you.

I'll try to write all the posts in english.

I know that I need to improve my english, and this one of the reasons to write in it, so sorry if I write something wrong and I appreciate any correction that help me to improve it.

The other reason is that it's the most popular language to speak and I believe that it's important to have the ability to communicate the ideas to most of the people.

Let's go!
