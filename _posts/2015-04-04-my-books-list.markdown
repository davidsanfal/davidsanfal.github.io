I believe that you can learn all you want in internet. However, there are situation in which a good book can help you to learn in deep about something or to begin to learn about it.

In any case, here is the book list with my favorite books or with ones I really want to read when I have time. I hope that you enjoy it!

I'll try to update this list when I have more time with more books and summaries about why they are interesting.
